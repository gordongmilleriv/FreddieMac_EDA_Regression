# Freddie Mac Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression Model

## Project motivation 
I did this project as a final project for a data science class at my university. My professor gave students a Freddie Mac data set and asked us to do something impressive with it. I made it my goal to extract as many insights from the data using exploratory data analysis techniques (univariate, bivariate and multivariate graphical and non-graphical analyses). My secondary goal was determining a reponse variable to predict using multiple linear regression, and maximizing the R squared for the model without compromising the generalizability of the model.
